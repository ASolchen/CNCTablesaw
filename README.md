# CNCTablesaw
Project from the Youtube Video CNC Table Saw By Jeremy Fielding
Feel free to use the code, change it do anything except sell it. It was meant to be free for all to learn and be inspired to try coding and engineering. Please also leave the video link and credit to Jeremy Fielding inside the code at the top. 

Because the code is free there is no tech support or followup help. There will certainly be issues, as I had many. Again we are here to learn.
